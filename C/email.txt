Hi,

Well isspace didn't work..

So I tryed some diffrent on accept '*' and '.'

file:
*.*. or *.2.
*.p.    *.1.
*9*.    *9*.
*.*.    *.

	    while (!(feof(infile)))
	    {
		
		
	 
		fscanf (infile,"%c", &car);
		
		if((car == '.') || (car == '*'))
		{
		
			printf("%c,%d\n",car,col);

			col = col +1;
		}
	    }

It still seems to return the last charater twice.
unless there is a charater at the end file, that is not reconize by the if statment above.
It will excute..

Thought some other's have no problem we have compared code but can't seem to find out why,
it does this.??
