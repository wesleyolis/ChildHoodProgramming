Toyj Readme please Read:
------------------------

I am aware of the error that one's get expect y.

please this error is not the restult of my progrming, but that of C feof function.
As C does not detect the end of file charater, in it has a windows eof char in it.
If there is a windows eof char then the eof function in c returns eof one charater later.

To Solve this problem please make sure all your file's are created with the unix eof charater.
Please be warned some editors in C althought set to Unix chara still append the windows eof char.

When createring toyJ files, please use Kwrite, make sure it's set to unix eof char.
*Then 'Save AS' the file imediatly! You may not have typed in the file at all before.
after you have done that you may type your contents of the file, and just save it again.

**There are to test files kwe.tj and test.tj in the tar file which do not produce this error,
as proof.
