Please make sure that the file you are using is creating in linux,
There must be no xtra chrater added on to the file when u save it,
from the operarating system, as this will cause DFA to display that
the image file has Errors.

If not sure go to line number 338 and comment that line out or in to see which works.


Kown Limitations
----------------

The number defined States can't exceed 8
i.e #define States 8 is the maxium it can be on my P4


Invert Colors of the image
--------------------------

First read in the image like normal, then once it has constructed the dfa,
Display the image, you sould see your normal image,
Then goto option 5 change Colors on the menu and switch the colors around.
Then Display the image Vala there you go.


High_verti Varible Explanation in implementation
------------------------------------------------

This varible was intend to record the highest vertical quad component
Reading from the right (as in binary numbers) that iwas not 0 i.e had
to be 1

Reason, Well if you thing that we adding the verti and hori componets to geather,
The anser will be the same as the hori components from the high_verti place to the left.
So to save time on would only add the the components up to that point.

Mainly noticible diffrence's on rather large images

Example1: image size 8X8, 3 States

	pixel in Row 0, Colom 5

	Colom - Hori Component:	101 
	Row - Verti Component:	000

	In this case High_verti = 3 not do any adding case  Sates > High_Verti, 3 > 3 
	This case answer	101

Example2: image size 8X8, 3 States

	pixel in Row 2, Colom 5

	Colom - Hori Component:	101 
	Row - Verti Component:	011

	In this case High_verti = 1 not do any adding case  Sates > High_Verti, 3 > 1
	and it would have add twice the other just used the hori 
	This case answer	113
